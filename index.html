      <h1>Online Gaming</h1>
      <p>A mobile game is a video game that is typically played on a mobile phone. The term also refers to all games
         that
         are played on any portable device, including from mobile phone (feature phone or smartphone), tablet, PDA to
         handheld game console, portable media player or graphing calculator, with and without network availability.
         The
         earliest known game on a mobile phone was a Tetris variant on the Hagenuk MT-2000 device from 1994.</p>

         <p> In 1997, Nokia launched Snake. Snake, which was pre-installed in most mobile devices manufactured by Nokia,
            has
            since become one of the most played games and is found on more than 350 million devices worldwide. Mobile
            devices
            became more computationally advanced allowing for downloading of games, though these were initially limited
            to
            phone carriers' own stores. Mobile gaming grew greatly with the development of app stores in 2008, such as
            the iOS
            App Store from Apple. As the first mobile content marketplace operated directly by a mobile-platform holder,
            the
            App Store significantly changed the consumer behavior and quickly broadened the market for mobile games, as
            almost
            every smartphone owner started to download mobile apps.

            alt="Genshin Impact">

         <p>
            Genshin Impactâ€Š is an action role-playing game developed by miHoYo, published by miHoYo in mainland China
            and worldwide by Cognosphere, d/b/a HoYoverse. It was released for Android, iOS, PlayStation 4, and Windows
            in 2020, and on PlayStation 5 in 2021. The game features an anime-style open-world environment and an
            action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching. A free-to-play game monetized
            through gacha game mechanics, Genshin Impact is expanded regularly through patches using the games as a
            service model.

         <p> Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, home to seven nations, each of which is tied to
            a different element and ruled by a different god (archon). The story follows The Traveler, an interstellar
            adventurer who, at the start of the game, is separated from their twin sibling after the two land in Teyvat.
            Thereafter, the Traveler journeys across the nations of Teyvat in search of the lost sibling, accompanied by
            their guide, Paimon. Along the way, the two befriend myriad individuals, become involved in the affairs of
            its nations, and begin to unravel the mysteries of the land.
         </p>
         <p> Development of Genshin Impact began in 2017, and takes inspiration from a variety of sources, including The
            Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, anime, Gnosticism, and an array of cultures and world mythologies.
            Genshin Impact has received generally positive reviews, with critics writing approving of its combat
            mechanics and its immersive open world. Conversely, some criticism has been directed at its simplistic
            endgame and its gacha-based monetization model. Across all platforms, the game is estimated to have grossed
            nearly $3.8 billion by the end of 2022, representing the highest ever first-year launch revenue for any
            video game.
